  <!--
    Reference dummy builds are used to compare NuGet packages to determine what actually changed and needs to be released when releases are published.
    They work by building and packaging all packages for both the previous version and the next versions of everything and then comparing the results.
    This means we need to eliminate meaningless differences between versions. We already implicitly use determinsitic builds, so most of this is already taken care of.
    
    Versions and the Git revision are obvious, but a more subtle one is skipping debug symbols. (Note also setting DebugType to `none` in the common props file.)
    PDBs are built deterministically too, but they contain an ID. One component that feeds into that ID is the hash of each dependency.
    However we don't want to release dependent packages when a dependency changes (otherwise we'd always release everything when Bonsai.Core changes and such.)
    We can't just ignore the PDBs in our comparison because the ID of the PDB is also embedded in the assembly.
    It isn't really expected that a PDB would change in a meaningful way when the assembly didn't, so ignoring them is fine.
    As such the easiest strategy is to just skip building them in the first place for reference dummy builds.
